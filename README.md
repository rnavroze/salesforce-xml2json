# salesforce-xml2json
Converts all the XML files to JSON in a given force-app directory. When finished, converts them back to XML.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. (Optional, you can skip this step if you don't know what it means) Create a virtualenv and activate it
3. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
python xml2json.py --toxml|--tojson|-x|-j file|directory

Converts all XML files in a given force-app dir to JSON, or vice-versa. The original XML files are not deleted. JSON files are only converted to XML if a corresponding XML file exists in the same directory. In other words, only JSON files which were generated by this tool will be converted back to XML files.

**Arguments**
 -j, --tojson:     Converts all XML files to JSON. Does not delete the original XML files.
 -x, --toxml:      Converts all JSON files with corresponding XML counterparts back to XML, and deletes the JSON file.
 file:             Path to a file.
 directory:        Path to force-app directory. It is recommended to run --tojson once followed by --toxml to update the line spacing and indentation first if you are planning to use this tool in a bulk fashion.
